Hi there! My name is Harrison Ngatia, I'm a software development student who loves to create innovative solutions for real-world problems. I'm passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to make a positive impact. I'm also a fan of chess, Sherlock Holmes, Marvel movies and game theory. I enjoy playing chess because it challenges me to think strategically and creatively. I admire Sherlock Holmes for his brilliant deductions and logical reasoning. I like Marvel movies because they are fun, action-packed and inspiring. I find game theory fascinating because it explores the interactions and outcomes of rational decision-makers. I'm always looking for new opportunities to grow and collaborate with other like-minded people. If you share any of these interests or want to know more about me, feel free to reach out!
